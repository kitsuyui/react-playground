# Clock

import { Canvas, Meta } from '@storybook/blocks'

import * as ClockStories from './Example.stories'

<Meta title="Base/Clock/Introduction" />
<Canvas of={ClockStories.Default} />

## Installation

Each component is published as a separate package.

Use npm, yarn or pnpm to install.

```sh
$ npm install @kitsuyui/react-clock
```

```sh
$ yarn add @kitsuyui/react-clock
```

```sh
$ pnpm add @kitsuyui/react-clock
```

## Usage

Clock components consists of two parts:

1. The surface of the clock (AnalogClock, DigitalClock, etc.)
2. The state of the clock (ClockContainer, DateContext, etc.)

If you want to modify the appearance of the clock, you can use the surface of the clock.
If you want to change the state of the clock, you can use the state of the clock.

```tsx
import {
  AnalogClock,
  ClockContainer,
  DateContext,
  DigitalClock,
} from '@kitsuyui/react-clock'
import React from 'react'

const Clock = () => {
  return (
    <ClockContainer refreshInterval={10}>
      <DateContext.Consumer>
        {(date) => (
          <>
            <AnalogClock timezone="Asia/Tokyo" date={date} />
            <DigitalClock timezone="Asia/Tokyo" date={date} />
          </>
        )}
      </DateContext.Consumer>
    </ClockContainer>
  )
}
```

`ClockContainer` is a component that manages the state of the clock.
The `refreshInterval` property is the interval at which the clock is updated.
`AnalogClock` and `DigitalClock` are components that display the clock. These components are independent of the state of the clock.
