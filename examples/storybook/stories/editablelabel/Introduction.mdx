# EditableLabel

import { Canvas, Meta } from '@storybook/blocks'

import * as editableLabelExample from './EditableLabel.stories'

<Meta title="Base/EditableLabel/Introduction" />

<Canvas of={editableLabelExample.Default} />

```jsx
const EditableLabelExample = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('Let\'s edit me!')
  return (
    <EditableLabel
      text={text}
      onEditComplete={(text: string) => setText(text)}
    />
  )
}
```

## Concept

A React component that can edit text by clicking.
What this means in DOM is usually a span tag, which becomes an input tag when clicked.
Other than that, no CSS is applied. CSS reset / decoration must be done by the user.

## Installation

Each component is published as a separate package.

Use npm, yarn or pnpm to install.

```sh
$ npm install @kitsuyui/react-editablelabel
```

```sh
$ yarn add @kitsuyui/react-editablelabel
```

```sh
$ pnpm add @kitsuyui/react-editablelabel
```
