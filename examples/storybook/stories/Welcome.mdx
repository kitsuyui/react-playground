# Welcome

import { Canvas, Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'

import * as ClockStories from './clock/Example.stories'

<Canvas of={ClockStories.Default} />

This is a collection of React components by [Kitsuyui](https://github.com/kitsuyui).

## Installation

Each component is published as a separate package.

Use npm, yarn or pnpm to install.

```sh
$ npm install @kitsuyui/react-clock
$ npm install @kitsuyui/react-stopwatch
$ npm install @kitsuyui/react-timer
$ npm install @kitsuyui/react-dekamoji
$ npm install @kitsuyui/react-measure
$ npm install @kitsuyui/react-treemap
```

## Usage

Clock, Stopwatch, Timer, etc. change their state depending on the time.
To separate the change of the state and the representation of the UI, I use React Context.
For example, the following code is a clock that displays the current time in Tokyo.
